# Model-Based Classification

Model-based classification is an unsupervised learning method that has broad applications in many disciplines. The difficulties of the classification problems often grow with the dimension of the datasets, as many commonly used techniques fail to handle the computational burden. The mbc package offers an implementation of Gibbs sampler as a more efficient solution to address this issue. 

This research was completed as coursework for “STAT 440: Computational Inference” taught by Dr. Martin Lysy at the University of Waterloo. All course material involved is distributed with the instructor’s permission.
